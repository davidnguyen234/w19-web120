 <h2 class="pageID">Responsive vs Mobile</h2>
 <br>
 <p>As the use of mobile phones continue to grow, more people and businesses are trying to decide if they should use a responsive website or mobile application. It all comes down to what your goals are. If your mobile goal is mostly to market yourself and provide user with content that can easily be maintained, then a responsive website may be the right choice. If you want to provide your user with a better personalized experience and functionality that is not possible with a responsive website, then you should consider using an app. However, responsive websites and mobile applications are not mutually exclusive. No one says you can not have both.</p><br>

<p>Responsive websites are sites that are based on CSS media queries. Which allows the website's content to fit into various screen sizes on different devices. Some of the advantages of responsive websites vs mobile applications is that they are available to all users because they don’t require downloading and are usually free. This can come in handle when looking for new customers. People looking for information are more likely search on a web browser before downloading an app. Responsive websites are also easier to update and fix bugs because users don’t have to install a new version. Lastly, responsive websites are less expensive to create because you don’t have to create native apps for each type of mobile phones and tablets.</p><br>

<p>Mobile applications are great because they offer users with a better experience. Every piece of the mobile app is custom built which allows more functionality that is not possible with responsive websites. This is perfect for users that plan on using your apps frequently. Some apps allow users to access content offline or receive push notifications. “Mobile app works better with hardware sensors like microphone, camera, GPS, etc., that improves acting with a device and makes user’s life easier. (ThinkMobilles)” Mobile apps are also faster when loading content because they don’t contain unnecessary elements. However, designing a mobile application can be more difficult than a responsive website because they require different sets of skills so they can be more expensive to create and maintain.</p><br>

 <p>My name is David Nguyen. I am currently working as an accountant but looking for a career change. I am going to Seattle Central for the associates of applied science in web development. After completing the associates, I am planning on transferring to North Seattle College for the bachelors in application development. Some of my interests include traveling, hiking, running and cooking.
